# go-convert-csv-to-md-table
A simple Go script to convert an .csv file to a markdown table.

It's bit of a specific use case but might be useful to someone else!

The reason I've created this is to convert some tables that I've exported from Notion as .csv files into markdown table format. On top of that, I'm learning Go so I wanted a little project :)
